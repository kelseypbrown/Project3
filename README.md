The data folder contains the jupyter notebook used for the initial cleaning (Top 10 2023 Data Clean Up) and the notebook used for the Spotify API pull (KB-Spotify API). The sqlite database used for our project was top2023_genres.db. The static folder contains our styling (style.css), any images we used, and the app.js. The templates contains our 5 HTMLs. Lastly, there is our Flask app in app.py.
